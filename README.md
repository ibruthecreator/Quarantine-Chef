## Story
Because why not:

Basically, entering university, I realized how expensive downtown was going to be especially for food. Instead of getting take out everyday, I decided to learn how to cook for once. For the first two weeks, it was chicken breast and rice, which got boring after a while. In searching up new recipes, I realized that I never have the ingredients that I need, nor do I have the time or money as a student to go on a grocery haul all the time.

Therefore, I have to make do with what I have.
